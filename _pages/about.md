Folarin Shola is a Ph.D. student in Applied Physics at University of South Florida (USA). He received his master's degree from African University of Science and Technology in 2019, where he applied indicator of nonclassicality to explore quantum states (such as Focks states and Schrodinger's cat states) and to also control tunneling in an ammonia system. His current research interests are finite temperature properties of relaxors using first principles based effective Hamiltonian and high-performance computing specifically focusing on ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics...
