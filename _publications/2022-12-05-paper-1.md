Caloric effects allow for temperature control through adiabatic application of external fields and are actively explored for solid-state refrigeration. The common wisdom is that the application of ultrahigh fields enhances the effects, thus providing a route to their practical applications. Using the ferroelectric relaxor (Ba, Ca)(Ti, Zr)O3
, we demonstrate that in ferroics, which are the prime candidates for such application, this is not true in general and that caloric effects can be enhanced through the reduction of the applied field. The explanation of such a counterintuitive response is in the dependence of the electrocaloric effect on the effective poling field that can be regarded as a “hidden” variable of the caloric effects.
